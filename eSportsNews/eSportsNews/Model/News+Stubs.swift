Astralis is aiming to trade a CS:GO player for an up-and-coming star.

The team is looking to acquire Sprout’s Victor “Staehr” Staehr in a trade that would see Asger “Farlig” Jensen go the other way, according to a report by Jaxon.GG.

Staehr only recently made a name for himself after being a crucial part of Sprout’s successful run at Europe RMR A for the IEM Rio Major. In the tournament, the team defeated forZe, Spirit, and B8, losing only to FaZe Clan after numerous overtimes. With a 3-1 record, they claimed a spot in the Legends Stage of the Major.

In the same tournament, Astralis failed to qualify and missed its first CS:GO Major as an organization. The team had to play with stand-in Mikkel “MistR” Thomsen, who replaced Kristian “k0nfig” Wienecke. The latter was released following the RMR after it revealed he participated in a fistfight in Malta.

Astralis also benched head coach Martin “trace” Heldt.

The team is also reportedly close to re-signing Nicolai “dev1ce” Reedtz. Reports indicate that both Astralis and NIP have agreed to a price for the player.

The transfer of Staehr cannot be made before the Brazilian Major, since the rules forbid orgs from changing their roster between the RMR and the Major.

100Thieves kicked off the last day of the 2022 League of Legends World Championship group stage with a convincing win against CTBC Flying Oyster. The North American team is the last one of their region still in the competition. But to make it to the playoffs stage, they needed to perform a miracle run, and they started their climb to the quarterfinals with a decisive performance.
                                 
It was a do-or-die situation for 100Thieves as they headed into what could have potentially been their elimination match. But the second seed of LCS gained control of the match from the first minutes on the map. By obtaining the first blood in the bot lane, 100T pressured their opponents under their tower, allowing Closer to get the first drake of the game.

With a jungle presence on the lower side of the map, CFO pushed back in the bot lane on the first occasion, but they had to give up the first Herald. The two teams exchanged objectives on the map, with CFO prioritizing towers and 100T all the drakes, reaching soul point at only 19 minutes of the game. With a lot of map control but no significant gold lead, 100T looked stronger than their opponents. In a fight in the mid lane, the North American team looked disjointed and not coordinated, as CFO took down two of their members.

Despite the successful outcome of the teamfight, CFO gained no advantage from it, while their opponents increased their map control with ward placement. This was pivotal to 100T win as it allowed them to set up the fights around the dragon’s pit perfectly. The LCS team initiated the fight around the dragon’s soul and flawlessly took down all the members of CFO, executing their first ace of the game.

With the ocean’s dragon soul on their side, 100T moved to push the bot lane until they took down the enemy’s inhibitor, backing down only when their opponents came back to life. CFO needed to find the right opportunity to strike down and look for fights that could overturn the situation. Even when they initiated the battle, it was always 100T who found the right picks to shut down their opponent’s composition.

100T had the game in the palm of their hands. Their map control and teamfight prowess shut down their opponents’ ability to come back, and with one last teamfight in front, the Elder Drake’s pit 100T found the second ace that led them to victory.

The last LCS team standing in the international competition executed the perfect game to initiate a miracle run, but whether they will succeed in locking down a spot for the playoffs stage is still undecided. Next they will have to face off against Royal Never Give Up, who has still to lose a game at the 2022 League World Championship.

Rogue are the sole LEC team to reach the playoffs stage of the 2022 League of Legends World Championship. After VCS champions GAM Esports came through against Top Esports and defeated them, Europe’s first seed automatically locked in their spot at the quarterfinals.
                                 
The LEC champions showcased individual technical prowess and mental resilience throughout the tournament, playing the game at their own rhythm and winning every time. Among the teams in Group C, Rogue has the highest kill-to-death ratio, with 71 kills obtained so far in the tournament, according to Oracle’s Elixir. Keeping in mind they still have two more games to play before their group stage run ends, they qualify for the Quarterfinal of the World Championship while being the undiscussed top team in their group.

Rogue’s road to success began in the first game of the LEC Summer Split Final against G2, and it never stopped. The LEC team won the European tournament without dropping a single game to G2, and they also kept on winning on the international stage. During their first week on the World Championship group stage, Rogue didn’t lose a single game either, and in the second week, they looked into the playoffs without giving up their winning streak.

                        Counter-Strike is one of the most in-depth, tactical, and teamplay-based games in all esports. The smallest movements can throw off your kills, and losing a weapon at the end of a round can ruin your economy, therefore ruining your chances later on in the game.
                                                         
                        This game is precision-perfect, and because of this, it can drive you up the wall with anger. Things go wrong constantly, and unless you’re a professional, you can get into that mindset that keeps you tilted and makes you want to rage-quit.
                        
                        With this being said, there are certain ways to fix this.
                        
                        You can use a stress ball, or you can just get yourself kicked from the CS:GO lobby. Sometimes the latter is the best way to just move on to the next match.
                        
                        How do I kick myself in CS:GO?
                        
                        Kicking yourself in CS:GO is one of the ways to leave without getting a ban. For those who have long-term bans beyond 30 minutes, there are instances that are forgivable. However, those who have seven-day bans, you brought this upon yourself.
                        
                        But you can still benefit from this, I can’t stop you from reading this.
                        
                        Unfortunately, it’s a process. The usual way of kicking players won’t get you anywhere, literally.
                        
                        Open up your console, if you don’t know how to do this, visit some of our other articles.
                        
                        Type “~” into the console, and then add “status” (no question marks needed), and then you’ll see a bunch of text pop up on in your console. Find your name within that list, then locate the digits on the left side of your name. Once you’ve got those numbers stuck in your noggin, type into the console “callvote kick number *** **”.
                        
                        Another example would be “callvote kick number 622 18”, and if those were your numbers, a vote-kick prompt would appear on your teammate’s screens.
                        
                        Don’t forget calling votes does affect your rating, which determines the caliber of players you match with. The lower your rating, the more toxic players you’ll find yourself with.
